        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hair systems have evolved dramatically over the last decade, becoming one of the most effective non-surgical solutions for men and women experiencing hair loss. Whether you're facing thinning, pattern baldness, alopecia, or seeking a cosmetic enhancement, modern hair systems offer natural, comfortable, and customizable results. At Lordhair, we’ve spent years perfecting the craft of hair replacement, ensuring wearers get the most realistic and confidence-boosting transformations possible.</p>

        <h2>What Is a Hair System?</h2>
        <p>A hair system is a non-surgical hair replacement solution made of human or synthetic hair hand-tied or injected into a base material such as lace, skin, or mono. Unlike traditional wigs, hair systems are designed to mimic your natural hairline and scalp, blending seamlessly with your existing hair. They’re light, breathable, and secure enough for everyday use—even during workouts or outdoor activities.</p>

        <h2>Types of Hair System Bases</h2>
        <p>The foundation of every hair system is the base. The three most popular categories include:</p>

        <h3>1. Lace Base</h3>
        <p>Lace systems are known for their breathability and natural-looking hairline. They’re ideal for active wearers or individuals living in warmer climates. Swiss lace provides maximum realism while French lace offers additional durability.</p>

        <h3>2. Polyurethane (Skin) Base</h3>
        <p>Skin bases provide the most natural scalp appearance due to their thin, skin-like finish. When hair is V-looped or injected, it appears as though it is growing directly from your scalp. These are perfect for wearers who prefer a sleek, undetectable look.</p>

        <h3>3. Mono Base</h3>
        <p>Mono bases are extremely durable and long-lasting, making them popular among salon professionals and heavy-duty wearers. They allow for excellent ventilation while offering a structured feel.</p>

        <h2>How Long Does a Hair System Last?</h2>
        <p>Durability depends on the base material and how the system is maintained. On average:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lace systems: 1–3 months</li>
            <li>Skin systems: 1–2 months</li>
            <li>Mono systems: 3–6 months</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Proper cleaning, adhesive care, and gentle handling significantly increase the lifespan of any unit.</p>
